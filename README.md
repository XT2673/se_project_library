### Notes from the author

This was the first "real" project I took on. I say that, because this was the first one they have an actual code reviewer going over your project. I think I did fairly well, considering it was only a few times I had to change things. Mostly just some cleaning up my CSS. Simple design, but I'm very proud of my work!
